The Industrial Revolution, which took place from the 18th to 19th centuries, was a period of significant technological, socioeconomic, and cultural change. This transformation began in Great Britain and quickly spread throughout Western Europe and North America. The transition included going from manual production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools. It also included the change from wood and other biofuels to coal. The textile industry was the first to adopt such changes, as cotton spinning was mechanized. The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in human history, as almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. It influenced the manufacture of new types of tools, the rise of the factory system, and important technological innovations in transportation and communication methods.`,
